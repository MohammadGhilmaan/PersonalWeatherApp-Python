# PersonalWeatherApp-Python
This is a simple weather app written in Python that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a given city. The app prompts the user to enter a city name, and then it makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the current weather data for that city.
